Messaging System 1.0 - RABADABA App 

MESSAGING SYSTEM IS HOUSED UNDER THE NOTIFICATIONS CARROT - SEPERATE TAB INSIDE OF HERE (SEE DESIGN)

Settings (located in the messaging tab of the notifications page)-

Accept Messages From: 
-Everyone
-Only Users I follow 

Push Notification Settinsg for Messaging (located in the push notifications settings in the main menu via profile page)-

Receive a Push Notification From:
-No one
-Everyone
-Only Users I Follow

Users will be allowed to send text messages (a la iMessage) to other users 
if the recipient's settings allow a message to be accepted.

Ideally, user can send full media, however, if necessary we can use the cropping
system that is currently used in the uploading process. 

For this first version of messaging, there will be a limit of one-to-one messaging (i.e. no group messaging- only one recipient)

USER STORY-SENDING A MESSAGE

SCENE 1:
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED:
USER A-sender
USER B-recipient (follows USER A and accepts messages from everyone)

USER A CHOOSES TO CREATE NEW MESSAGE
USER A INPUTS @USERNAME (in this case @USERB and @USERB comes up via hot search because @USERB Follows USER A and His settings allow messages to be received by everyone)
USER A: hello mate, here's a picture of my cat
USER A: (picture of cat is sent)
USER B: Nice cat, bro! 

SCENE 2:
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED:
USER A-Sender
USER B-recipient (USER B FOLLOWS USER A and only accepts messages from users he follows)

USER A CHOOSES TO CREATE A NEW MESSAGE
USER A INPUTS @USERNAME (in this case @USERB and @USERB Comes up via hot search because @USERB folows USER A and his settings allow messages to be received only people he follows which he does in
the case of USER A)
USER A: Hello mate, here's a video of my cat
USER A: (video of cat is sent)
USER B: Nice cat video, friend


SCENE 3:
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED:
USER A-SENDER
USER B-RECIPIENT (USER B DOES NOT FOLLOW USER A, however he has chosen to accept messages from everyone so this message will still be sent)

USER A CHOOSES TO CREATE A NEW MESSAGE
USER A INPUTS @USERNAME (in this case @USERB would appear in the hot search because he has chosen to accept messages from everyone)
USER A: Hello stranger who I really don't know, look at this cat that i found in the street
USER A: (photo of feral cat sent)
USER B: hey, i don't know you but great cat pic!

SCENE 4:
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED:
USER A-SENDER
USER B-INTENDED RECIPIENT (USER B DOES NOT FOLLOW USER A and has his settings as to only allow messages from users that he follows)

USER A CHOOSES TO CREATE A NEW MESSAGE
USER A INPUTS @USERNAME (in this case @USERB would not appear in the hot search since he's chosen not to receive messages from those he does not follow-however if USERA continues
to type out @USERA manually he'll be able to do so)
